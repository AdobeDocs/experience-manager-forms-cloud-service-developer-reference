# AEM Forms Cloud Service

Adobe Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service is a cloud-native solution for businesses to create, manage, publish, and update complex digital forms and communications while integrating submitted data with back-end processes, business rules, and saving data in an external data store.

## AEM Forms Communications APIs

AEM Forms Communications APIs capability offers a suite of APIs designed to empower you in crafting brand-consistent, personalized, and standardized documents. Whether it's business correspondences, statements, claim processing letters, benefit notices, monthly bills, or welcome kits, these APIs streamline the creation process. Additionally, our APIs ensure the security and protection of your documents. With the AEM Forms Communications API, you have the flexibility to seamlessly combine, rearrange, and validate PDF documents to meet your specific needs.

Empowered by tools and programming language support tailored to developers' existing skill sets, you can now effortlessly craft engaging and uniform communication experiences centered around PDF documents.

![Communications templates](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/experience-manager-forms-cloud-service-developer-reference/blob/main/src/pages/assets/templates.jpeg?raw=true "Communications templates")

The AEM Forms Communications APIs encompass three key categories: [Document Generation APIs](#document-generation-api-for-automating-document-workflows-document-generation-communications-apis), [Document Manipulation APIs](#document-manipulation-to-automate-for-your-document-workflows-document-manipulation-communications-apis), and [Document Assurance APIs](#document-assurance-to-secure-and-protect-your-documents-document-assurance-communications-apis). These powerful tools are designed to elevate your capabilities, delivering streamlined, faster, and branded experiences. By controlling user interaction with your documents, you can effectively streamline communication workflows, enhancing user engagement and retention.

These APIs are available in two flavors:

* [Synchronous APIs](references/output-sync.md) are suitable for on-demand, low latency, and single record document generation use cases. These APIs are more suitable for user-action based use cases. For example, generating a document after a user fill a form.

* [Asynchronous APIs (Batch APIs)](references/output-batch.md) are suitable for scheduled, high throughput, and multiple document generation use cases. These APIs generate documents in batches. For example, phone bills, credit card statements, and benefits statements generated every month.

### Document Generation API for automating document workflows

The Document Generation APIs allows you to produce high fidelity PDF documents with dynamic data inputs. Using Document Generation API, you can merge your data(for example, XML data) with XFA templates to create dynamic documents for contracts and agreements, invoices, proposals, reports, forms, branded marketing documents and more. Additionally, these APIs provide features to convert XFA documents to PS, PCL, and ZPL formats,

The Document Generation APIs seamlessly [integrates with Microsoft Power Automate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/adobeexperiencemanag/) through user-friendly connectors, providing a hassle-free and efficient integration experience.

### Document Manipulation to automate for your document workflows

The [Document Manipulation APIs](references/assembler-sync.md) help to combine, rearrange, and validate PDF documents. Typically, you create a DDX and submit it to document manipulation APIs to assemble or rearrange a document. The [DDX document](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/experience-manager/forms-cloud-service/ddxRef.pdf) provides instructions on how to use the source documents to produce a set of required documents. The DDX reference documentation provides detailed information about all the supported operations.

You can use the document manipulation APIs to convert a PDF document to a PDF/A-compliant document and to determine whether a PDF document is PDF/A-compliant. PDF/A is an archival format meant for long-term preservation of the document's content.

Some examples of document manipulation are:

* Assemble a simple PDF document
* Create a PDF Portfolio
* Assemble encrypted documents
* Assemble documents using Bates numbering
* Flatten and assemble document
* Extract pages from a source document
* Convert to and validate PDF/A-compliant documents
* Divide a source document based on bookmarks

### Document Assurance to secure and protect your documents

The [Document Assurance APIs](references/docassurance.md) help encrypt, decrypt, and digitally sign your documents. When a document is encrypted, its contents become unreadable. You can encrypt the entire PDF document (including its content, metadata, and attachments), everything other than its metadata, or only the attachments. You can also certify a document before it is sent to a user to open by using Acrobat or Adobe Reader, validate a signature that was added to a form by using Acrobat or Adobe Reader, sign a document on behalf of a public notary.

### Forms Service APIs

Forms service generates interactive PDF forms for data capture. It can also be used to import or export data to and from an existing interactive PDF form and validate submitted data. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

* **Rendering Forms**: Generate an interactive PDF form from a template created using AEM Forms Designer and, optionally, XML data. This essentially produces a fillable PDF form optionally pre-filled with data.
* **Data Extraction and Import**: Import data into an existing PDF form as well as extract data from a filled PDF form. Both XDP and XML data formats are supported, and importing to non-XFA PDF forms (also known as AcroForms) additionally supports FDF and XFDF data.
* **Data Validation**: Validate submitted data, in XDP or XML format, against a template created using AEM Forms Designer.

**NOTE:** The **Document Assurance APIs** and **Forms Service APIs** are under early adopter program. You can write to `aem-forms-ea@adobe.com` from your official email address to join the early adopter program and request access to the Document Assurance capability.

## Edge Delivery Services for Forms (Forms Submission Service)

Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms is a composable set of services that enables a rapid development environment where authors can update, publish, and launch new forms rapidly. These services deliver exceptional and high impact forms experiences that drive engagement and conversions. These forms experiences are easy to author and develop.

### Forms Submission Service API

The [Forms Submission Service API](references/aem-forms-submission-service.md) is designed to handle the submission of form data. When a user fills out a form, the API ensures that all the entered information is collected and sent to the correct destination for processing.

#### How It Works:

1. Data Collection: All the information entered by the user is gathered into a field called data.
1. Form Identification: Each form has a unique identifier, which is a Base64-encoded path. This identifier helps the system recognize which specific form has been submitted.
1. Submission: The API takes the data and the form's unique identifier to process and store the submitted information appropriately.

In simple terms, the API acts as a messenger that takes the user's filled-in form data and delivers it to the right place, ensuring that the system knows exactly which form was submitted.

### Community forum and feedback

Customer feedback is particularly valuable as it helps the team validate use cases, guide development, and troubleshoot issues.
